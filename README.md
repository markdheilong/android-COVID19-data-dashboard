COVID19 data analytics dashboard
About: March 26, 2020

This endeavour is to create a freely available android app data analytics dashboard for users to track the data, analyze outcomes (cause and effect), and modify behaviour to 'flatten the curve' of the spread of the COVID19 pandemic virus.
Development is hoped to be completed in a quick time frame so that more people can download the app and use it as a single point of reference (SPR) of data, information and actions taken (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive) to help combat the COVID19 pandemic.
Goals:
1. Not to have overwhelmed hospita ICUs
2. Prevent large scale mass outbreaks of COVID19 cases through rolling infections and recovery of cases
3. Achieve herd immunity of 60% through confirmed test cases recorded as a data point
4. Get the economy back to working in a rolling recovery method
5. Protect the vulnerable by researching ways to prevent the spread of infection
6. Protect the population through actionable insights gleaned from research to results and then to action

Although these are just some of my goals, I'm sure they're not exhaustive, but is welcome to anyone else looking to help share data, information and actions that will reduce the rate of transmission of infections and speed up the recovery of the economy in a rolling fashion.

Ultimately, taking action by the entire group will help keep us protected until a vaccine has been tested and proven effective to innoculate the population from infection in the very near future.

Any and all contributions to this endeavour are welcome. Speed is of the essence. Free is for the liberty of all.
